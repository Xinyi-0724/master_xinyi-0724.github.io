Fair machine learning has been an emerging topic recently, since existing unfair machine learning system appears to confront ethical even legal risk, as well as income or welfare loss. In this work, we study the unfairness caused by missing-notat-random (MNAR) phenomenon that is common in extensive tasks, e.g. ad display and medical treatment, and build our fair machine learning measures, namely Gini index (GI) and Global utility (GU) drawn from Economics. We further propose a novel Learning-from-Counterfactuals (LearnCF) framework for debiasing policy learning, and give its theoretical generalization bound. Besides, our analysis of asymptotics of the uniform policy, which is often employed to generate small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for counterfactual learning, shows that it is far more than representative for usersâ€™ preference, when alternative action space is large. By contrast, our LearnCF is free of expensive RCTs, and empirically proved to benefit the policy utility (GU) and fairness (GI) at the same time.
