## TA for Learning from Data [[syllabus]](http://ryanwangzf.github.io/files/19fall_learning_from_data_syllabus.pdf) [[code]](https://github.com/RyanWangZf/Learning_From_Data_2019_Fall)
*2019 Fall, TBSI, Instructor: **Yang Li, Shao-Lun Huang***
> This course involves many concepts, techniques, and algorithms in machine learning, beginning with topics such as logistic regression and SVM and ending up with more recent topics such as deep neural networks and reinforcement learning. The course gives the student the basic ideas and intuition behind modern machine learning methods as well as a bit more formal understanding of how, why, and when they work. The underlying theme in the course is statistical inference as it provides the foundation for most of the methods covered.

I was TA responsible for programming assignment together with the other one TA for written assignment. We successfully taught machine learning to 50+ TBSI students with diverse backgrounds, including computer sceience, electrical engineering, medical engineering,  material enngineering, etc.
