My name is Zifeng Wang. I am currently a second year M.S. student of Data Science, from Lab 2C, [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI)](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, fortunately co-advised by Professor [Shao-Lun Huang, TBSI](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/en/index.php?s=/cms/181.html) and Professor [Khalid M. Mosalam, UC-Berkeley](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/en/index.php?s=/cms/182.html). Before that, I received my B.S. degree from Tongji University in 2018.

I appreciate researches with reproducibility, and interpretability in mathematics, rather than those striving for incremental performance with massive implementation tricks.  I have been studying in data subsampling, in order to quantitatively measure data's *quality* and improve the machine learning model's robustness and performance with selected sub samples. Currently, my interests lie on four points:

- **Counterfactual learning**. Learning from sparse and selective labeled user-item pairs to estimate true interests of users. I am working on new counterfactual learning regime for debiasing policy to improve policy fairness and global utility for all users.

- **Semi-supervised learning**. Using limited labeled data to do pseudo label imputation, and doing label calibration by influence subsampling methods.

- **Distributionally robust subsampling**. Developing distributionally robust influence function (IF) that measures one sample's influence over a set of distributions, rather than specific one, to improve robustness of IF subsampling.

- **Graph neural network**. Leveraging GNN to learn representations from knowledge graph, for better information retrieval system.

Besides, I also work in AI's application in smart building and construction, with Professor Khalid M. Mosalam.
