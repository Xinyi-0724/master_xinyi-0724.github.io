My name is Zifeng Wang. I am currently a second year M.S. student of Data Science, from [Lab 2C, Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI)](https://tbsi.berkeley.edu/lab-2c-internet-things-societal-cyber-physical-systems), Tsinghua University, fortunately co-advised by Professor [Shao-Lun Huang, TBSI](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/en/index.php?s=/cms/181.html) and Professor [Khalid M. Mosalam, UC-Berkeley](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/mosalam). Before that, I received my B.S. degree from Tongji University in 2018.

I appreciate researches with reproducibility, and interpretability in mathematics, rather than those striving for incremental performance with dense implementation tricks.  I have been studying statistical machine learning theory, in order to develop interpretable and trustworthy machine learning system. Currently, my interests mainly lie on four points:

- **Fair recommender system**. Learning from sparse and selective labeled user-item pairs to estimate true interests of users. I am working on new counterfactual learning regime for debiasing policy to improve policy fairness and global utility for all users.
- **Interpretable disease diagnosis**. Leveraging Graph Neural Networks to learn representations from knowledge graph, for disease diagnosis with symptoms.
- **Semi-supervised learning**. Using limited labeled data to do pseudo label imputation, and doing label calibration by influence subsampling methods.
- **Distributionally robust subsampling and transfer learning**. Developing distributionally robust influence function (IF) that measures one sample's influence over a set of distributions, rather than specific one, to improve robustness of IF subsampling.

Besides, I also work in AI's application in smart building and construction, with Professor Khalid M. Mosalam.
