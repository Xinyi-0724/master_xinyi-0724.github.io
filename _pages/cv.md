3. **Zifeng Wang** and Suzhen Li. *Data-driven Risk Assessment on Urban Pipeline Network Based on a Cluster Model*. **Reliability Engineering and System Safety**. (under review)

Industry Experience
======
* Jarvis Lab, CSIG, Tencent, Shenzhen, China, Dec. 2019 - Present
  * Using Graph Convolutional Network for query analysis and recommendation.
  * Study counterfactual learning free of randomized trials for debiasing policy and improving fairness.
  * Study semi-supervised learning for pseudo labeling with intepretable label imputation and calibration.

* Noah's Ark  Lab, Huawei, Shenzhen, China, April 2019 - Oct. 2019
  * Study counterfactual learning for improving ad-click rates by exploiting non-displayed events, results published in CIKM 2019.
  * Employ one class field-aware factorization machine for queries recommendation with implicit feedback, work submited to JMLR.
  * Research in guiding data subsampling for better model with less data, based on influence function and robust supervised learning theory, which is applicable for highly sparse data (> 10M dims), publish in AAAI 2020 (ML track, score 8,7,6; accept rate: 18%).

* Enigma Investment, Shanghai, China, April 2018 - July 2018
  * Mine techincal factors for intra day stock price prediction.
  * Build ARIMA + LSTM model for price prediction, and design T + 0 transaction strategy in the second market.

Research in Progress
======
* Learning from Counterfactuals
  * Research in sparse logged feedback, that observed labeled user-item pairs are much smaller than all possible pairs, which causes unfair and biased policy in practice.
  * Propose a novel *Learning-from-Counterfactuals* (LearnCF) framework, shown to alleviate policy bias in our preliminary results. We are currently proceeding for ICML 2020.

Projects
======
* Synthetic Vision Module Development for Indoor Robot, Shenzhen, China, Feb. 2019 - Aug. 2019, [[code]](https://github.com/RyanWangZf/Lab2cRobot-Beta/tree/zifeng)
  * Develop face recognition module on MTCNN and pretrained InceptionV1 for 1:N face verification.
  * Develop indoor object detection module based on YOLO-V3, and object tracking module on Siamese FCN.

Skills & Certification
======
* English: CET-6 (615), IELTS(7.0)
* CS: Linux, C, Python and packages including pytorch, tensorflow, numpy, scipy, pandas, sklearn, etc.

Other Achievements
======
* In TBSI Workshop On Data Science (WODS) 2019, *Less Is Better: Unweighted Data Subsampling via Influence Function*. (**Best Student Research Runner-up**)
* Kaggle: KKBox Music Recommendation Challenge (151/1081, 15%), Dec. 2017
* Meriorious winner (1st class prize) in USA Mathematical Contest in Modeling, April 2017
